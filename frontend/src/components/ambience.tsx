/**
 * The single ambient background for the entire product — landing, auth, and
 * the app workspace all mount this once (from the root layout) so the
 * "living" quality is consistent everywhere instead of the marketing page
 * feeling designed and everything past login feeling abandoned.
 *
 * Built from five layers, back to front:
 *   1. Aurora — five huge, heavily-blurred, organically-morphing colour
 *      fields laid over plain white at low opacity, so they read as soft
 *      colour washes rather than a flat gradient. Three are present from the
 *      top of the page; two more fade in only once you scroll past the
 *      platform and research sections, so the composition visibly gains new
 *      colour as you go rather than just re-arranging the same three blobs.
 *      Every field also parallaxes against scroll at its own rate (through a
 *      spring, so it trails rather than tracking 1:1) and slowly morphs its
 *      own silhouette (`border-radius` keyframes, not just a scaling circle)
 *      — the combination is what reads as depth and motion rather than
 *      wallpaper, and is what visibly shifts as the page is scrolled.
 *   2. Conic sheen — a very faint, slowly-rotating conic gradient behind the
 *      aurora. Barely perceptible on a still frame; over tens of seconds it
 *      reads as a subtle rotation of light across the whole page.
 *   3. Cursor spotlight — a small warm glow that follows the pointer with a
 *      lag spring. Kept very faint; it should register as "the page notices
 *      you" on a still frame, not as a visible following blob.
 *   4. Dot grid — faint, masked to fade at the edges so it reads as texture
 *      in the gaps between panels, never as a pattern behind content.
 *   5. Grain — a tiled SVG turbulence texture at very low opacity. The detail
 *      that keeps a flat white ground from looking like a mockup.
 *
 * Everything here is transform/opacity, fixed, -z-10 and pointer-events:none,
 * so it never affects layout, hit-testing, or scroll performance.
