"""
One-off metadata patch: adds a `numeric_ranges_conditional` field to each of
the 6 existing artifacts_v6/{category}/{task}/schema.json files. Does NOT
retrain any model and does NOT touch data/raw/*.csv -- it only recomputes a
smarter statistic from the exact same (unchanged) train split
train_specialists.py already used, and merges it into the existing schema
artifact.

Why this is needed: schema.json's existing `numeric_ranges` is one flat
(min, max) per feature, pooled across every row in the specialist. For a few
fields that's actively misleading, because their meaningful scale depends on
a categorical context:

  - indicator_threshold / initial_indicator_value: scale depends on which
    (indicator_type, indicator_unit) the row is for. Verified example:
    hard/safety_endpoint's *pooled* indicator_threshold range is degenerate
    (2.0-2.0, since listeria_monocytogenes/log CFU/g is its only indicator)
    while other specialists mix log CFU/g (0-8), pH (0-14), presence/25g
    (0/1), meq peroxide/kg (0-4000+) etc. into one meaningless pooled range.
  - canonical_concentration_value: scale depends on canonical_concentration_unit.
    Verified example: hard/safety_endpoint's pooled range is 0.0-495.3,
    mixing % w/w (0.017-3.0), AU/g (52-397), IU/g (50-495), log CFU/g
    (5.0-7.6), and mg/kg (5.6-8.7) into one number that can't meaningfully
    flag extrapolation for any single unit.

`numeric_ranges_conditional` stores, per affected feature, the (min, max)
grouped by its real conditioning column(s), so model_service.py's
assess_support() can compare a submitted value against the RIGHT range
instead of the pooled one -- a smarter check on the same data, not a changed
dataset.

Usage: python patch_v6_conditional_ranges.py
