"""
Resolve a representative photo for each cheese in the V6 catalog via the
public Wikipedia REST/Action APIs (no API key, no scraping -- these are
documented, stable, publicly-supported endpoints). Only Wikimedia Commons /
Wikipedia content is used, which carries genuine open licenses (CC-BY-SA or
public domain) and requires only attribution -- never hotlinks to arbitrary
sites with no redistribution rights.

For each base_cheese_name:
  1. Search Wikipedia for the name (search API, appending "cheese" only when
     the name doesn't already contain it -- a doubled-up query like
     "processed cheese cheese" visibly confuses the search ranking).
  2. Fetch the top result's page summary (REST API) for its thumbnail +
     description + canonical URL.
  3. Sanity-check the result is actually about cheese (the word "cheese" or
     "milk" appears in the extract) before accepting it, and require at
     least one non-trivial word overlap between the query name and the
     resolved title (unless the title came from a verified
     DIRECT_TITLE_OVERRIDES synonym) -- rejects unrelated-but-cheese-related
     false positives.

Writes frontend/src/data/cheese-images.json: { [base_cheese_name]: {
  imageUrl, thumbUrl, title, pageUrl, license } | null }
A null entry means no confident match was found -- the frontend renders a
graceful fallback (no fabricated/guessed image), not a broken link.

Usage: python resolve_cheese_images.py
